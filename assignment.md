# Assignment

## Brief

Write the SQL statements for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as SQL in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Using the `claim` and `car` tables, write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, claim_date, travel_time, claim_amt` from `claim`, and `car_type, car_use` from `car`. Use an appropriate join based on the `car_id`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT c.id, c.claim_date, c.travel_time, c.claim_amt, car.car_type, car.car_use
FROM claim c
INNER JOIN car ON c.car_id = car.id
```

### Question 2

Write a SQL query to compute the running total of the `travel_time` column for each `car_id` in the `claim` table. The resulting table should contain `id, car_id, travel_time, running_total`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT
	id, car_id, travel_time, 
	sum(travel_time) OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY id) AS running_total
FROM claim
ORDER BY car_id;
```

### Question 3

Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, resale_value, car_use` from `car`, where the car resale value is less than the average resale value for the car use.

Answer:

```sql
WITH avg_resale_value_by_car_use AS (
	SELECT car_use, AVG(resale_value) AS avg_resale_value
	FROM car
	GROUP BY car_use
)
SELECT id, resale_value, c1.car_use
FROM car c1
INNER JOIN avg_resale_value_by_car_use c2
ON c1.car_use = c2.car_use
WHERE resale_value < avg_resale_value;
```
